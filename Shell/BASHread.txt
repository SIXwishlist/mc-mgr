Bash script creates or reattaches a shell named by the unique token specified by a user session.  The shell then runs a command from a PHP POST inside of the shell.

In the future the shell will return the output of the command to the PHP script to update the DOM with the Bash shell output.

If the token expires or the user logs out, the PHP script sends a sDestroy command to the script which terminates the shell with that user token.
